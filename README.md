- **Event Display**: Events are displayed in the correct time order on the calendar view.
- **Color Selection**: Users can choose a color when creating an event, and the event will be displayed with the selected color.
- **Concurrent Events**: Proper handling of events that occur at the same time, ensuring they are displayed correctly.
- **Event Editing**: Users can edit events, including the title, date, time, and color.
- **Event Deletion**: Ability to delete events.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Users can drag and drop events to change their date and time.
- **Date Navigation**: Allows users to navigate between months, weeks, and specific dates by clicking.

## Technical Details:

- **UI Components**: MUI (Material-UI) components were used for buttons and user interaction elements.
- **Routing**: Integrated `react-router-dom` for simulating page navigation between different views in the app.

This project demonstrates the ability to build an interactive and user-friendly event calendar with modern front-end technologies.
